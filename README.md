Login Links
===========

Displays a login link for each user on your site. Simply navigate to any user's
profile, then click on the 'Login link' tab.

This may be useful if you need to easily give someone access to your site (just
share the link with them). Obviously these links should never be shared
publicly, or given to anyone you don't trust.
